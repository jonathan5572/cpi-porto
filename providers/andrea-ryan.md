Dr. Ryan is board-certified in Internal Medicine and has been practicing hospitalist medicine since completing residency. She earned her undergraduate degree at University of Colorado in Boulder and completed her medical training at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Biddeford, Maine. She is happy to be practicing in Colorado again where much of her family lives and where she can enjoy the many outdoor pastimes that Colorado has to offer. She has participated in the 9News HealthFair, other community events and is on Littleton Hospital's committee to address and prevent Catheter-Acquired Urinary Tract Infection.
