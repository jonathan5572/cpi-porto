A co-director of Littleton Adventist Hospital's ICU, Dr. Portnoy is board certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine and Critical Care. He earned his MD from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, serving his residency at McGill's Jewish General Hospital. Coming to Denver, he served two fellowships â€” the first in Pulmonary and Critical Care at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center; the second at internationally regarded National Jewish Health. Research and care advanced pioneered at both these institutions have helped establish Colorado as a leader in pulmonary care. Dr. Portnoy and his CPI colleagues take pride in contributing to such strides and in sharing their knowledge with the next generation of physicians.
