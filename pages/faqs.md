        <label>How long will my appointment take?</label>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Most consultations take between 40 minutes to one hour depending on what you’re being seen for.

        <label>What is an Intensivist?</label>
        <div class="toggle-content"><p>Intensivists are board-certified physicians with special training in critical care medicine.
