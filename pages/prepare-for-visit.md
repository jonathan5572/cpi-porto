Please bring a list of medications including the dosage and directions (or all medications in a bag), as well as your insurance cards and driverâ€™s license. If you are being seen for sleep related issues and are on therapy, please bring your machine along with its tubing, mask, and power cord so we can download and review the data. Please check-in 20 minutes prior to your appointment thus allowing for nursing time to review of your health information and obtain your vitals.

If this is your first time visiting our office you can save time by creating your profile on our patient portal. The patient portal allows you to fill out all your paperwork electronically. Or if you prefer, you may print those documents from the patient forms tab, fill out, and bring them with you to your appointment instead.
