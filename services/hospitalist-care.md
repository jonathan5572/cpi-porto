Hospitalists are physicians whose primary professional focus is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. By focusing his or her practice on the care of hospitalized patient, a hospitalist can gain a great deal of experience in the unique aspects of a patientâ€™s needs during the hospital stay. Hospitalists typically spend most or all of their work day in the hospital, and thus can be more readily available to a patient than a doctor who spends much the day outside the hospital in an office or clinic setting.

Our hospitalists are all board-certified internal medicine physicians who desire to care for patients during their hospital stay. They coordinate testing, specialist referrals and communicate with the primary care physician, patient and family members regarding treatment and work toward timely discharge.

Our hospitalists are Michael McMillan, MD; Andrea Ryan, DO; Fred Wolf, MD; and Tessa Henderson, NP.
