<p class="lead">Innovative Asthma Treatment Now Available at Colorado Pulmonary Intensivists</p>

Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT), a non-drug outpatient treatment for patients over the age of 18 suffering from severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonists. The innovative procedure delivers radio frequency energy to the airway walls. This reduces excessive airway smooth muscle and in turn decreases the ability of the airways to constrict and narrow in response to a trigger, thereby reducing the frequency of asthma attacks. New 5-year data:

88% decrease in respiratory related ER visits over 5 years
48% decrease in severe exacerbation rates
Significant reduction in steroid use over 5 years
Are you ready for a fuller life with fewer asthma attacks? Perhaps itâ€™s time to look beyond medication alone.

Contact us today to schedule your Bronchial Thermoplasty consultation with Dr. Kelly Greene or Dr. Evan Stepp. A staff member is awaiting your call at 303-952-1100.
