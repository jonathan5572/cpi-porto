Littleton Adventist Hospital is recognized as a premier provider of health care in the south metro Denver area. Its intensive care unit (ICU) is staffed and equipped to provide continuous, comprehensive care for those who are critically ill as the result of injury, illness or surgery.

Hospital leaders have chosen the physicians in our practice to serve as the ICU’s intensivists. This means our specialists are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to guide patient care.

National statistics show that hospitals with intensivists deliver higher quality care and greater satisfaction among patients, families and referring physicians. Other benefits of having intensivists on staff include:
• Improved outcomes
• Shorter ICU lengths of stay
• Fewer complications
• Lower costs per case
• A greater focus on patient safety

We are here to help assure these gains are realized.
