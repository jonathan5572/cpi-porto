A sleep study is often ordered by a primary physician, specialist, or one of our treating pulmonologists to find out what is causing certain symptoms, such as daytime sleepiness, excessive snoring, or difficulty breathing.

Most sleep studies are done overnight at our medical office. Patients are fitted with equipment which monitors sleep patterns, lung capacity, and other information. Gender-specific sleep staff observe the patient from a separate room. Different airway equipment may be tried during the night to see if breathing improves.

Dr. Ballard reads the study and makes his recommendations to the referring physician.

In an effort to fully evaluate lung function, we offer pulmonary function testing in our office which allows you to avoid the facility fee of a hospital, and convenience of doing the test with people you know and know you.

We offer many services at our sleep center, including:
• Outpatient sleep studies
• Outpatient consultations
• Mask fittings and mask adjustments
• Sleep hygiene
• Management of sleep therapies, including CPAP, BIPAP, and advanced ASV
• Ongoing management and compliance or insurance
