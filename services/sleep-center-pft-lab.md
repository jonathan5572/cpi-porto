A sleep study is often ordered by a primary physician, specialist, or one of our treating pulmonologists to find out what is causing certain symptoms, such as daytime sleepiness, excessive snoring, or difficulty breathing.

Most sleep studies are done overnight at our medical office. Patients are fitted with equipment which monitors sleep patterns, lung capacity, and other information. Gender-specific sleep staff observe the patient from a separate room. Different airway equipment may be tried during the night to see if breathing improves.

Dr. Ballard reads the study and makes his recommendations to the referring physician.

In an effort to fully evaluate lung function, we offer pulmonary function testing in our office which allows you to avoid the facility fee of a hospital, and convenience of doing the test with people you know and know you.

We offer many services at our sleep center, including: • Outpatient sleep studies
• Outpatient consultations
• Mask fittings and mask adjustments
• Sleep hygiene
• Management of sleep therapies, including CPAP, BIPAP, and advanced ASV
• Ongoing management and compliance or insurance

## COVID-19 Announcements

1. We are still seeing new and existing patients using Telehealth options, but are not conducting in-person visits at this time. If you would like to schedule an appointment, please call (303) 952-1100.
2. At the recommendation of the CDC and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), we are not conducting in-lab sleep studies at this time. We will resume in-lab testing when it is safe. Unfortunately we do not have a date when in-lab sleep testing will resume. We understand this can be frustrating, but your safety is our greatest priority. We appreciate your patience.
3. We are continuing to offer home sleep studies at this time. If your doctor has ordered a home sleep test, and you would like to schedule, please call (303) 952-1106.
4. You can safely use your PAP machine during this time unless otherwise directed by your physician.
5. If you have questions or concerns about PAP therapy, postponement of your sleep study, or your course of treatment, please make an appointment with your provider by calling (303) 952-1100.
6. Please continue cleaning your PAP mask and accessories as directed. Dr. Ballard, our sleep medicine director, recommends washing your mask/humidifier/tubing at least once a week using Dawn dish soap and warm water, and then allowing to air dry. You may increase the frequency of washing your mask if you are concerned about infection or you are sick.
7. In addition to the COVID-19 related Q&A for PAP patients, taken from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine website, Dr. Ballard recommends that if you are a current PAP therapy user, and you have a bed partner, that sleeping in separate rooms is the best option to avoid potentially infecting a bed partner with COVID-19. The exhalation port on the PAP mask may increase risk of spreading COVID-19 even when you are asymptomatic.
